R package that converts transcripts to graphs (networks), includes parameters relevant to educational research

## About and Purpose
Many disciplines use transcripts to record sequential information. Transcripts that capture a conversation can become long, making systematic analyses difficult or time-consuming. This package allows researchers to visualize transcripts in a succinct format through the lens of graph theory. [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) is a discipline of mathematics involving "nodes" and "edges" that model objects and the relations between them. The goal is to get more information from transcripts through this alternative view.

Graphs, nodes, and edges may be characterized in various ways. For example, the number of edges connected to any particular node is called the node's degree. Another example, the number of edges in a graph divided by the number of possible edges is called the density of the graph. We consider these characteristics of graphs (calling them "parameters") and pick out the relevant ones for educational researchers.
